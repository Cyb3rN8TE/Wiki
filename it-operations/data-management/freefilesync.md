# FreeFileSync

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

FreeFileSync is a file-level backup and synchronization software that enables users to efficiently create and manage backup copies of their important files. It offers robust backup and synchronization capabilities by intelligently determining the differences between a source and a target folder, transferring only the minimum amount of data necessary during each operation. This incremental approach not only saves time but also reduces resource usage, making backups quicker and more efficient.

Key features of FreeFileSync include:

Mirror Synchronization

* Creates an exact copy of the source folder in the target location.
* Deletes any files in the target that do not exist in the source.
* Ensures the target is an up-to-date replica of the source data.
* Ideal for maintaining consistent backups without retaining old versions.

#### Two-Way Synchronization

* Allows bidirectional updates between source and target folders.
* Synchronizes changes made in either location.
* Reflects new files or modifications from one location to the other.
* Useful for collaborative environments and multi-location workflows.

#### Task Scheduling

* Automates backup and synchronization tasks at specified times.
* Users can set regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) for execution.
* Ensures consistent data protection without manual intervention.
* Helps maintain up-to-date backups effortlessly.

#### RealTimeSync

* Monitors specified folders for changes and initiates synchronization immediately.
* Quickly reflects new files or changes in the backup location.
* Provides real-time protection against data loss.
* Ideal for users who frequently update files and require current backups.
