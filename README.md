# Welcome

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/homebanner.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## G'day Champions üèÜ - Welcome to the Cyb3rN8TE Wiki <a href="#gday-champions-welcome-to-the-cyb3rn8te-wiki" id="gday-champions-welcome-to-the-cyb3rn8te-wiki"></a>

This wiki serves as a repository of knowledge acquired through four years of hands-on experience in the information technology and cybersecurity field.

During my tenure as a junior security analyst and IT systems administrator, I have gained extensive exposure to various software tools, hardware, attack/defence procedures, and security best practices. To excel in systems administration alone requires a vast amount of knowledge and refinement, and integrating cybersecurity adds another layer of complexity. Cybersecurity is a continuous learning journey, and just when one feels competent as a sysadmin or engineer, it can feel like starting from scratch. To address this, I wanted to create a centralised system to safely and effectively document my learnings with a structured approach. The end goal being that I can easily recall information such as scripts, software usage, attack methods, and defence strategies whenever needed.

At some point, I realised that this wiki could be a valuable way to give back to the industry. I felt immensely grateful for the opportunity to build a career in cybersecurity, especially considering the extremely competitive nature of the market. It almost felt like a miracle that a non-graduate, working at McDonald's, could break into the industry.

From speaking with other people in the industry, reading forums, and from my own experiences, I've noticed that some workplaces may not have the ideal structure in place to support newcomers in the field of cybersecurity. This can include inadequate training, limited promotion opportunities, restrictions on learning experiences, and a lack of a structured knowledge base or training program. I created this wiki to provide guidance for others who may be facing similar challenges.

I hope you find the information in this wiki beneficial. Feel free to reach out to me via my socials at any time if you want to chat about the industry or just have a friendly chat.

Cheers,

Nathan
